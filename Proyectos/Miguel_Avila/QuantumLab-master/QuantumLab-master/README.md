# QuantumLab

This project consists of five elements:
- QLab app (Source code folder)
- Numerical Simulation of the Probability Distribution in a Wave Function.pdf
- NSPDWF - Presentation.pdf
- Python Installation Manual - With Libraries.pdf
- QLab App - Use Manual.pdf

The paper (Numerical Simulation of the Probability Distribution in a Wave Function.pdf) and implementation (QLab app) describes the use of Monte Carlo's Integration method and a Composite Quadrature Rule (also a integration method) to numerically simulate the behavior of the probability distribution in the Wave Function H1s of the Hydrogen atom. The paper also mentions and develops the general integration of the probability distribution in a general wave function.

The document 'NSPDWF - Presentation.pdf' is a beamer like presentation which as all the .pdf files in this repository was written in LaTeX.
